## Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a label or category to an input image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in learning hierarchical features from images and achieving state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.

This project provides a complete implementation of an image classification model using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The code demonstrates the process of data loading, model definition, training, testing, and visualization of the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the image classification model should be organized in a specific format. Each class or category should have its own directory, and the images belonging to that class should be placed inside the respective directory.

For example:
```
dataset/
    class_1/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    class_2/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    ...
```

Make sure to preprocess and normalize the images as required by your specific dataset.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers: These layers learn to extract features from the input images by applying convolution operations with learnable filters. The architecture includes three convolutional layers with increasing number of filters (6, 6, 12) and a fixed kernel size of 3x3.
- Max pooling layers: Following each convolutional layer, max pooling is applied to downsample the feature maps and reduce spatial dimensions while retaining the most important features.
- Flatten layer: The output from the last convolutional and pooling layer is flattened into a 1D vector to be fed into the fully connected layer.
- Fully connected layer: This layer takes the flattened features and learns to classify them into the desired number of classes.
- Softmax activation: The output of the fully connected layer is passed through a softmax activation function to obtain the predicted class probabilities.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the format described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. Update the code to specify the paths to your training and testing data loaders.
3. Run the code to train the CNN model on your dataset.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to measure its performance.
5. Visualize the training and testing losses and accuracies using the generated plots.

## Implementation Details

### Data Loaders
The `train_loader` and `test_loader` are assumed to be data loaders that yield batches of images and their corresponding labels. You need to implement these data loaders based on your specific dataset and preprocessing requirements.

### CNN Model
The `CNN` class defines the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network used for image classification. It includes convolutional layers, max pooling layers, a flatten layer, and a fully connected layer. The `call` method defines the forward pass of the model.

### Training
The training process is implemented in the `train` function. It iterates over the training data loader for a specified number of epochs. In each epoch, it performs the following steps:
1. Calls the `train_step` function for each batch of images and labels.
2. Computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's trainable variables using `tf.GradientTape`.
3. Applies the gradients to update the model's parameters using an optimizer.
4. Accumulates the training loss for each batch.
5. Returns the average training loss for the epoch.

### Testing
The testing process is implemented in the `test` function. It evaluates the trained model on the test dataset. For each batch of images and labels, it performs the following steps:
1. Calls the `test_step` function to compute the model's predictions and loss.
2. Computes the accuracy by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels.
3. Accumulates the test loss and accuracy for each batch.
4. Finds the incorrect predictions and counts them for each class.
5. Returns the average test loss, overall accuracy, and incorrect counts for each class.

### Visualization
The code includes visualization of the training and testing losses and accuracies using Matplotlib. It plots the losses and accuracies over the epochs to monitor the model's performance during training.

## Results
After training the CNN model on your dataset, you can evaluate its performance on the test dataset. The code provides the test loss, overall accuracy, and the count of incorrect predictions for each class.

You can also visualize the training and testing losses and accuracies using the generated plots to analyze the model's learning progress and identify any potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
